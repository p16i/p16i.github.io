  date: "2019"
  desc: >
    A data-driven article reveals how Thailand's local admistrative authorities spend their budgets in 2018.
    Not only showing  a certain type of procurement methods highly used, the data also presents interesting connections between
    such authorities and a number of companies. This work was part of Data Journalism Camp Thailand 2019.

- title: "AttaCut: Fast and Reasonably Accurate Tokenizer for Thai"
  date: "2019"
  desc: >
    Previous tokenizers for Thai are either fast with low accuracy or the opposite. In this work, we propose
    a new tokenizer based on a CNN model and the dilation technique. Our models show comparable tokenization performances yet at least 6x faster than the state-of-the-art.
    We plan to release our final models under PyThaiNLP's distribution.  We gave an oral presentation at NeurIPS 2019 New in ML Workshop.

- title: Parliament Listening
  date: "2019"
  desc: >
    A pilot project that aims to collect what being discussed in each parliament meeting.
    Having this kind of data will allow us to build various tools and applications that individuals can easily engage or interact.
    Hence, they would be well informed about the country's situtaion and potentially make a better decision in next elections.

    The website contains a collection of tokenisation benchmarks for Thai as well as visualization of the results.
    Not only looking at the numbers, the visualization allows Thai NLP researchers to see qualitative pespectives of benchmark, visually seeing when
    each algorithm perform well and when not.

    The goal of this visualization is to reveal business activities of each politician.
    From the visualisation, one can see the relationships between political parties and companies that support them.
    Moreover, integrating with Thailand's government spending data allows us to see the connections between producement campaigns and those companies.

- title: Visually Similar Image Search
  date: "2019"
  desc: >
    Finding similar images can be useful in many cases. For example, one can use it to retrieve mountain photos
    from a ton of photos in his/her gallery. Our first experiment achieves this search by using a nearest neighbour approach
    over features produced by pretrained neural networks. Currently, we are testing with techniques such as
    autoencoders, Siamese networks, and TripetLoss.

- title: Designing RNNs for Explainability (M.Sc. Thesis)
  date: "2018"
  desc: >
    We study how the architecture of RNNs influences the level of explainability. We use existing
    explaination methods, such as LRP, Deep Taylor Decomposition, and Guided Backprop, to explain prediction from RNNs.
    Our experiments show that RNN architectures can have significantly different levels of explainability although they perform
    equally well in terms of an objective function.

    Particle filter algorithm is a nonparametric approach using a set of particles to approximate
    the posterior distribution of some random processes. In this project, we develop a robot
    simulator and implement the algorithm to localize the location of a robot in mazes.

- title: Black Box Optimization using RNNs
  date: "2017"
  desc: >
    We extend on the work of Chen et al. (2016), who introduce a new learning-based approach to global Black-Box optimization.
    They train a LSTM model on functions sampled from Gaussian processes, learning to find an point that 
    those training functions. We verified the claims made by the authors and conducted further experiments using various loss functions.
    We also applied these learned LSTM models to airfoil optimization and hyperparameter tuning of a SVM classifier. 
    Our experiments show that the learning approach can produces optimizers that perform comparably to state-of-the-art Black-Box optimization algorithms on these benchmarks

- title: Code Generation for Apache Flink's NormalizedKeySorter
  date: "2016"
  desc: >
    The current implementation of NormalizedKeySorter is a generic implementation for all data types. Although this implementation
    has an advantage of code maintenance, it creates unneccesary CPU branches for certain data types, causing needless latency. We solve
    this problem by online creating a customer sorter for each data type. Our experiments show that this code-generated approach
    reduces running time significantly.

    This project is a proof-of-concept showing how to use Amazon AWS's Lamba as a massive-scale data pipeline. 
    For the IRS990 dataset, this approach can reduces the processing time down to to 25 minutes, significantly faster than
    using other approaches, such as Apache Spark, directly.
